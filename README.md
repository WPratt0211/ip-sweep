# ip-sweep
A lightweight and simple bash script for sweeping and logging IP addresses within a network.

Just run the script with ```./ipsweep.sh {IP HERE} > file.txt```

Be sure to replace ```{IP HERE}``` with the network IP that you're wanting to sweep.

After you run the script, you can ```cat``` the output file and you should see the results there.
